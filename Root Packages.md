# concurrently (DevDependancy)

The concurrently package is a Node.js utility that lets you run multiple commands simultaneously in the same terminal,  
which is especially useful in full-stack projects where you want to run the frontend and backend servers at the same time.

### concurrently Installation (as a DevDependancy):

    npm install -D concurrently

### Why Use concurrently?

In a typical full-stack setup, you often want to:
- run your React frontend (npm run dev inside /frontend)
- and your Node/Express backend (npm run server inside /backend)

Instead of opening two terminals, you can run both with concurrently.
